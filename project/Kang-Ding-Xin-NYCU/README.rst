Basic Information
=================

PolygonAreaCalaulator

`GitHub Repository <https://github.com/Kang-Ding-Xin-NYCU/PolygonAreaCaculator>`_


Problem to Solve
================

* Easily get the the area of polygons and the image of polygons and can calculate the polygon with hole
* connect the one inner polygon vertice to one outer polygon vertice(cutline) and change the calculate direction when move from outer polygon to inner polygon(eg. counterclockwise to clockwise) 

System Architecture
===================

* input : vertices of polygons
* produces results : do some matrix operations and draw the image
* result : the area of polygons and the image of polygons

API Description
===============

.. code-block:: c++

class polygon{
    public:
        void input(std::queue<float> in_x, std::queue<float> in_y);

        void print();

        float area();

    private:
        std::queue<float> x, y;
};

Engineering Infrastructure
==========================

* build : make
* version control : git
* testing and CI : git actions

Schedule
========

* Week 1 (09/20):survey the method to implement the area calculation and drawing image
* Week 2 (09/27):setting the environment to implement the functions
* Week 3 (10/04):write c++ code to implement the area calaulation
* Week 4 (10/11):write python to implement the image drawing & try to write CI and testing to make sure the major function can run properly
* Week 5 (10/18):try to find a way to accelerate the computing
* Week 6 (10/25):try to add some extra function
* Week 7 (11/01):fix any problem
* Week 8 (11/08):prepare final proposal
