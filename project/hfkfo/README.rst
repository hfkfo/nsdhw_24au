**Project**: Boolean Operations on Polygons

**GitHub**: https://github.com/hfkfo/Boolean_Operations_on_Polygons

******************
 Problem to Solve
******************
**Boolean operations on polygons** involve combining two or more polygons using

set operations like union, intersection, difference, and exclusive-or (XOR).

Boolean operations on polygons are critical in various fields such as computer
graphics, computational geometry, GIS (Geographic Information Systems), 
CAD (Computer-Aided Design), and game development.
The main objective of project is to compute Boolean operations on polygons.

*********************
 System Architecture
*********************

**Input** : 
    - Coordinates of the vertices of a polygons
    - The boolean operation

**Process** : 
    - Cut the edges of polygon into smaller segments at the intersection points. 
      This way, all edges to be processed will only intersect at endpoints.
    - Based on the boolean operation, select the edges depending on 
      whether they lie inside the other polygon's interior.
    - Join the edges together to obtain the output.

**Output** : 
    - Get coordinates of the vertices of a polygons
    - Use Matplotlib to visualize the result,
      generating the polygons after Boolean operations.

 API Description
*****************

.. code:: c++

    class Bool_Op{
        int op;
        // Union = 0 , Intersection = 1, Difference = 2, XOR = 3
        vector<Polygon> p_list;
        // The input of Polygons
        void cutting_edge();
        void selecting_edge();
        void joining_edge();
    };
